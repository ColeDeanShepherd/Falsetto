# Automatic Theory Analysis Notes
* How would I do analysis?
  * 
* Ideas:
  * sliding windows of note frequencies for key/scale detection
  * scale degree labels
  * continuous "confidence"
  * phrase detection (knowledge of measures & key signatures?)
  * key changes are when key confidence decreases as time window expands?

* Notes
  * Could utilize MIDI channels!
