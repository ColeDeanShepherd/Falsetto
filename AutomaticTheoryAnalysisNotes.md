# Automatic Theory Analysis Notes
* How would I do analysis?
  * 
* Ideas:
  * sliding windows of note frequencies for key/scale detection
  * scale degree labels
  * continuous "confidence"
  * phrase detection (knowledge of measures & key signatures?)
* Test cases
  * scales
    * ascending & descending scale
    * unordered scale
    * scale with chromatic notes
  * chords
    * chord played all at once
    * chord with notes staggered
    * chord inversions
    * arpeggios
    * arpeggios (and chords?) with added notes to ignore
    * diatonic chords
      * neapolitan sixth
  * multiple hands
  
* Player should accept MIDI data outside of files for tests/procgen

* Notes
  * Could utilize MIDI channels!
